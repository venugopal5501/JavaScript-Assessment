    <p>Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted . You'll
        be deactivated for sure. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
        Now come out before sombody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? I'm not in there!
        I'm going to regret this. There gores one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. it must have been
        short-circuited. That's funny, the damage
        doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe ?
